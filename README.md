# Finger-Drawing-by-Image-Processing

I created an Image Processing application for user to draw and remove any curves on screen by hand gestures recognition. This algorithm is implemented by OpenCV in C++ and it is run on Vusual Studio 2013. Demo video is shown here (https://youtu.be/MQjTc3g36MY).

The algorithm consists four steps: skin color filter -> find contour -> convex hull algorithm -> gesture recognition
I defined three gestures: draw, delete, do nothing
